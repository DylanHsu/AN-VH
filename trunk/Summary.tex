An inclusive search for the Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs with $\pt > 450\GeV$ and reconstructed as a single jet, has been presented using a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by CMS corresponding to $35.9\fbinv$ at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$. 
The Higgs jets are reconstructed with the anti-$\kt$ algorithm with radius $R=0.8$ and identified with the CMS double-$\cPqb$ tag algorithm. The signal is then extracted on top of the falling QCD soft drop mass distribution (including contributions from $\PW$, $\PZ$, and top background processes) using an entirely data-driven QCD background prediction.

The analysis strategy is validated by extracting the signal strength of the $\PZ+$jets process. The $\PZ+$jets process is observed for the first time in the single-jet topology with a significance of $\muZObsSig\sigma$.
% and signal strength parameter of $\mu_\PZ =\muZVal_{-\muZErrLo}^{+\muZErrHi}$. 

The Higgs signal is measured with a strength parameter of $\mu=\muVal_{-\muErrLo}^{+\muErrHi}$, and an observed significance of $\muObsSig\sigma$ ($\muExpSig\sigma$ expected for the standard model Higgs) when including Higgs $\pt$ spectrum corrections accounting for NLO and finite top mass effects. The measured cross section of the $\PH(\bbbar)$ production for $\pt>450\GeV$ is $\xsecVal_{-\xsecErrLo}^{+\xsecErrHi}$~fb, which is consistent with the SM expectation within the uncertainty.
